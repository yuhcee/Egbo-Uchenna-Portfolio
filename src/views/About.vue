    <p>I am a human...laden with every characteristic of being human.</p>

    <p>
      Times and seasons are not alien to me; but I have come to understand that
      the only way forward is to constantly embrace my challenges and attack my
      fears. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, but with the knowledge that true
      character lies in the ability to forge ahead regardless of circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>I Change My Mind - I Change My World... One-Step, then the Other!</p>

    <p>
      In a constant sojourn to abstract meaning of life's essence, purpose, and
      existence... assisting others with the things I have struggled with,
      becoming a better version of myself everyday, with inclination to the
      divine succor.
    </p>

    <p>
      My wish is to <b>‚ÄúLIVE‚Äù</b> - to the fullest, having explored all
      potentials, exhausted all talents, and attempted every impossibility with
      a daring vigor.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, I wish to take a long look back, relishing the craziest
      moments, the horrifying mistakes, and the most challenging times with an
      accomplished smile beaming on my face appreciating that it was all worth
      it because I <b>‚ÄúDared To LIVE‚Äù</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love being happy and staying healthy. My hobbies includes painting,
      music, travelling, football and comedy. I am a software engineer by
      profession with primary focus on Web and Blockchain development.
