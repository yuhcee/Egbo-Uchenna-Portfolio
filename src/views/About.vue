    <p>I am a human... laden with every characteristic of being human.</p>

    <p>
      Times and seasons are not alien to me; but I have learned, that the only
      way forward is to constantly embrace my challenges and attack my fears.
      Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, but with the understanding that true
      character lies only in the ability to forge ahead no matter the
      circumstances. I MOVE!!!.
    </p>

    <p>I Change My Mind, and I Change My World...One-Step, then the Other!</p>

    <p>
      In a constant sojourn to make meaning of life's essence, purpose, and
      existence... assisting others with the things I've struggled with, and
      becoming a better version of myself each passing day, with inclination to
      the divine succor.
    </p>

    <p>
      My wish is to “LIVE”,… to the fullest, having explored all potentials,
      exhausted all talents, and attempted every impossibility with a daring
      vigor.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, I wish to really take a long look back, relishing the craziest
      moments, the horrifying mistakes, and the most challenging times with an
      accomplished smile beaming on my face appreciating that it was all worth
      it because I <b>“Dared To LIVE”</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like to be happy and stay healthy. I love painting, music, travelling
      and making people laugh. I also know a thing or two about software
      engineering and web development.
    </p>
